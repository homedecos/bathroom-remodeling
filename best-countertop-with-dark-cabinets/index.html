What Color Countertops Go With Black Home From homedecorbliss.com
Hickory is a very hard, heavy and dense wood, which makes it a very good choice for kitchen cabinets due to its natural beauty and durability. If you have a plain color countertop, go for a matchstick backsplash which makes a blending transition between your dark cabinets and white countertops. Since dark cabinets in a kitchen can be overpowering when it comes to other elements of the kitchen space, pairing dark cabinets with a light colored countertop is the best option. The touch of gray tones would have been the most effective thing in the elegant contrast of black and white.
